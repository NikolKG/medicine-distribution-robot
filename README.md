<h1 align="center">medicine distribution robot</h1>

This project is part of a final academic project at [SCE - Shamoon College of Engineering](https://sce.ac.il)This project contain a web app for searching places around zip code using Zippoptam API.

The project involve mechanical assembly, electronics circutes and Control Flow of Program.

### 🏠 Medicine distribution robot

In this project, I research and develop solution for medicine distribution in hospital.
The project includes 3 main parts:
1. medicines sorting.
2. medicines distribution.
3. Control Flow of Program.
First we designed the robot in SolidWorks drawing software,
then we printed the parts in a 3D printer and then we added electronic components that were connected to a control circuit and programmed by flow control.
